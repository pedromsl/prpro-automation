# Premiere Pro - Automation

This is my try to automate Adobe Premiere and to eventually get a nice hotbox setup, like in some VFX programs.

I'm basically winging it because my python experience is very limited and help is very appreciated!

Heavily inspired by [Taran's Premiere AHK scripts](https://github.com/TaranVH/2nd-keyboard), but I decided to do it in Python to have a greater functionality and accessibility. AHK also has some limitations being a scripting language.

We're using mainly [pywinauto](https://github.com/pywinauto/pywinauto) as a base for everything.

I'll update this ReadMe file soon. For now, I've set up a [discord server](https://discord.gg/Uy5X7xn) that you can contact me on if you have any doubts or you want to help out in any way.
